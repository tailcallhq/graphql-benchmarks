## Introduction

This document presents a comparative analysis of several renowned GraphQL frameworks. Dive deep into the performance metrics, and get insights into their throughput and latency.

> **NOTE:** This is a work in progress suite of benchmarks, and we would appreciate help from the community to add more frameworks or tune the existing ones for better performance.

## Quick Start

Get started with the benchmarks:

1. Click on this [link](https://codespaces.new/tailcallhq/graphql-benchmarks) to set up on GitHub Codespaces.
2. Once set up in Codespaces, initiate the benchmark tests:

```bash
./setup.sh
./run_benchmarks.sh
```

## Benchmark Results

<!-- PERFORMANCE_RESULTS_START -->

| Server | Requests/sec | Latency (ms) |
|--------:|--------------:|--------------:|
| [Tailcall] | `7,419.24` | `13.46` |
| [Caliban] | `7,276.43` | `13.73` |
| [Gqlgen] | `2,121.85` | `48.68` |
| [Apollo GraphQL] | `1,827.35` | `54.58` |
| [Netflix DGS] | `1,349.72` | `78.38` |

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture.png)

A client (`wrk`) sends requests to a GraphQL server to fetch post titles. The GraphQL server, in turn, retrieves data from an external source, `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`, routed through the `nginx` reverse proxy. Here is the complete GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  posts {
    title
  }
}
```

### WRK

`wrk` serves as our test client, sending GraphQL requests at a high rate.

### GraphQL

Our tested GraphQL server. We evaluated various implementations, ensuring no caching on the GraphQL server side.

### Nginx

A reverse-proxy that caches every response, mitigating rate-limiting and reducing network uncertainties.

### Jsonplaceholder

The primary upstream service forming the base for our GraphQL API. We query its `/posts` API via the GraphQL server.

## GraphQL Schema

Inspect the generated GraphQL schema employed for the benchmarks:

```graphql
schema {
  query: Query
}

type Query {
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  userId: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
}
```
